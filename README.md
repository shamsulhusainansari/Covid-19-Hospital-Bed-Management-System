# Covid-19-Hospital-Bed-Management-System

The Covid-19 Hospital Bed Management System should record all the data regarding the total number of beds available in the hospital, and total beds occupied, and total beds unoccupied. It must also record the number of patients who are getting treated in the hospital and how many days that patient will require the bed. It must also record how many patients can the management admit so that there is no excess of patients than the number of beds available in the hospital.
